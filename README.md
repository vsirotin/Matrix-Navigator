# Matrix-Navigator-
Navigation for multi-rubric and multi-languages sites

Matrix Navigator is a very simple navigation solution for small web site with pages divided into many rubrics and many languages. One can image a multi-rubric and multi-languages site as a matrix (with rubrics as columns and languages as rows). 
How this solution works, you can see by my home page www.sirotin.eu
